# The length of the set in your code is `2` because of how sets in Python handle equality and hashing of different data types.

# Hereâ€™s the code for reference:

# ```python
s = set()
s.add(20)
s.add(20.0)
s.add("20")

print(len(s))
# Output: 2
# ```

# Let's break down why this happens:

# 1. **Adding `20`**: The integer `20` is added to the set.
# 2. **Adding `20.0`**: The float `20.0` is considered equal to the integer `20` because, in Python, `20 == 20.0` evaluates to `True`. Since sets do not allow duplicate values and use the `==` operator to check for equality, `20.0` is not added as a new element.
# 3. **Adding `"20"`**: The string `"20"` is a different data type and not considered equal to the integer `20` or the float `20.0`. Therefore, it is added as a unique element to the set.

# So, the set `s` ends up containing two unique elements: `20` (which could be either the integer `20` or the float `20.0`, but not both) and `"20"`.

# ```python
print(s)  # Output: {20, '20'}
# ```

# Therefore, the length of the set `s` is `2`.

# This behavior can be summarized as follows:
# - In Python, integers and floats are considered equal if they represent the same value (`20 == 20.0` is `True`).
# - Sets in Python use both equality (`==`) and hashing to determine if an element is unique.
# - Since `20` and `20.0` are considered equal, adding both to a set results in only one element being stored.
# - The string `"20"` is distinct from the integer `20` and the float `20.0`, so it is stored as a separate element in the set.
